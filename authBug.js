The Firebase SDK's `onAuthStateChanged` listener might not trigger consistently across different platforms or network conditions.  This can lead to unexpected behavior where authentication state changes are not reflected in the application's UI or logic. For example, a user might successfully log in, but the app doesn't update to reflect the logged-in state, or vice versa.  Another subtle issue is that the listener might fire multiple times with the same authentication state, leading to redundant code execution.
