# Inconsistent Firebase onAuthStateChanged Listener

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with the Firebase `onAuthStateChanged` listener.  In some scenarios, the listener may not trigger reliably, causing inconsistencies in the application's authentication state.  The `authBug.js` file showcases the problem, while `authSolution.js` provides a more robust solution.

**Problem:** The `onAuthStateChanged` listener might not consistently reflect changes in the authentication state due to network conditions or platform differences.  This can lead to unexpected application behavior, such as the app failing to correctly display the user's logged-in status.

**Solution:** The provided solution enhances the reliability of authentication state updates using improved error handling and potential debouncing techniques to prevent duplicate listener firings.
